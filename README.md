# Address Book Application in C

This project is a menu-driven Address Book application developed using the C programming language. It was implemented as part of my Embedded Systems skill training at Emertxe Information Technologies under the ESSCI CPR Program.

The application allows users to manage contact information efficiently and ensures persistent storage of data using a CSV file.
